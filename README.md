LeetCode - C# Solution

Techniques:

Array: Range Addition/Prefix, Boundary Swap (Dutch Flag), Sliding Window/Two Pointers
*Use temp for swapping results in significant better performance compared to swap in-place

Bit Manipulation: n &= (n - 1), Subset a bitmask from 0 to 2^n - 1, Get Bit, Clear Bit, ~ for flip, & for get/clear, | for get/set | ^ for get/set/clear/flip

LinkedList: Floyd Algorithm, Reverse
